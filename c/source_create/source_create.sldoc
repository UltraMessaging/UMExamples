    <h1>Source Create</h1>
    <p>This is an example application demonstrating how to create an Ultra Messaging source object (publisher). An Ultra Messaging source is
       resposible for publishing messages to receivers on the topic that it is bounch to. Conceptually, a source object is contained within
       a context object. A source object is only able to publish messages on a single topic and on a single transport.</p>
    <p>A source transport is one of the UM transports provided, such as Reliable Multicast (LBTRM), Reliable Unicast (LBTRU), as well as TCP, 
       and the inter-host transports IPC and SMX. Source transports are determined by the source attribute 
       =semlit,tooltip,../../tooltips/source_transport.txt,transport=. No code changes are required to use the different transports, only the 
       configuration attribute needs to be modified. By default, all sources are TCP.</p>
    <p>There is one program source file:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b><tt>=semlit,srcfile,source_create_c.slsrc,source_create.c=</tt></b></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Program explanation: <tt>source_create.c</tt></h2>
    <h4>Create the Context</h4>
        <p>In this block of code, the application is creating a context attribute object and creating a context for the source to be contained in.</p>
        =semlit,insert,init_create_context=
    <h4>Source Attribute Create</h4>
        <p>In this block, the API lbm_src_topic_attr_create() is called to initialize the attribute object that will be used when a topic is allocated</p>
        =semlit,insert,attr_create=
    <h4>Topic Allocation</h4>
        <p>The lbm_src_topic_alloc() allocates a topic object which is used to create a source in the next step. The topic object contains the source
           attributes that were initialized in the previous block as well as the topic string that the source will publish messages as</p>
        =semlit,insert,topic_alloc=
    <h4>Create Source</h4>
        <p>lbm_src_create() is the API that is called to create the source object. The pointer to the source object is passed in first, followed by the 
           context object that the source will be contained in, and the topic object that was previously allocated. The remaining parameters are optional.
        =semlit,insert,src_create=
    <h4>Delete the Attribute Object</h4>
        <p>Once the topic is allocated, the application no longer needs the attribute object so it should be deleted. Note, the attribute object can 
           be used to allocate other topic objects, so it may be worth keeping around if the application is creating multiple sources.</p>
        =semlit,insert,attr_delete=
    <h4>Delete the Source</h4>
        <p>Once the application is done with a source object, it is a good idea to delete the source and free up any resources that were allocated
           for the source, like the retransmission buffers for a reliale UDP transport for example</p>
        =semlit,insert,delete_source=
    <h4>Includes</h4>
        <p>Include files for this application. Notice the Windows specific include files - these are not necessary for Linux only applications</p>
        =semlit,insert,includes=
