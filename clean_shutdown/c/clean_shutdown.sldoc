    <p>There is one program source file:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b><tt>=semlit,srcfile,clean_shutdown_c.slsrc,clean_shutdown.c=</tt></b>
        - (right-click and save as "clean_shutdown.c") main program.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Program explanation: <tt>clean_shutdown.c</tt></h2>
    <h4>Create Event Queue and Context</h4>
	<p>Event queue objects live outside an Ultra Messaging context, so this sample will create the event queue. When cleaning up
	the objects later, it is important to delete the context before deleting the context. When it comes to creating and inializing
	the objects, it does not actually matter which one gets created first. For consistency purposes, this sample will create the 
	event queue first.</p>
	=semlit,insert,eq_ctx_create=
    <h4>Create Source and Receiver</h4>
	<p>A context is needed to create a source and receiver because sources and receiver live within a UM context. As we'll see
	later, it is important to delete all sources and receivers before deleting the context.</p>
	=semlit,insert,src_rcv_create=
    <h4>Spawn Event Queue Thread</h4>
	<p>In this example, the application spawns a new thread whose sole purpose will be to process event queue events. This is a typical
	application use case as users would want an independent thread that only processes events (like messages) for better performace.</p>
	=semlit,insert,spawn_thread=
    <h4>Sleep, Send Message, and Wait</h4>
	<p>The application will now sleep for 1 second to allow the receiver to discover the source via topic resolution, which should be 
	plenty of time. After the 1 second sleep, the application will send a single message. After sending the message, the main application
	thread will simply wait for the receiver to receive the message on the event queue.</p>
	=semlit,insert,wait_and_send=
    <h4>Unblock Event Queue and Kill Thread</h4>
	<p>Now that the event queue has processed the message, it is time to join with the event queue thread. To ensure that the event queue
	thread is not blocked on the dispatch API, we can force unblock it right from the application thread. After unblocking it, join the 
	thread before continuing.</p>
	=semlit,insert,unblock_join=
    <h4>Delete Objects in the Correct Order</h4>
	<p>By this point in the applicaiton, the receiver's message is deleted and the event queue is not waiting for any events and its thread
	has been closed. The application can now delete all UM objects <b>in the correct order</b>.<p>
	=semlit,insert,delete=
    <h4>Error Checking</h4>
        <p>Error handling can be one of the most complicated issues facing a programmer. Each application may have its own unique error
        handling conventions. For these example programs, a very simplistic error handling approach is taken: if anything unexpected happens,
        print a message and exit the program:</p>
        =semlit,insert,error_check=
        <p>The EX_LBM_CHK() macro checks a UM API return value. If negative, it assumes an error. One reason for making this a macro is so
        that the __FILE__ and __LINE__ compiler built-ins reference the file and line of the usages of the macro, not the file and line of
        the macro defintion itself.</p>
        </p>Most UM functions are designed to return one of only two integer values: 0 for success and -1 for failure. The lbm.h header file
        defines the symbols LBM_OK and LBM_FAILURE respectively for these. However, there are a few functions which can return a value of 0 or
        greater in the event of success (for example: lbm_event_dispatch() and lbm_send_response() to name two). So the example EX_LBM_CHK()
        macro was written to be somewhat more general. However, be aware that there are a few other functions which do not return an integer
        status at all (for exmaple: lbm_serialize_response() to name one). Please refer to the API documentation for each UM function you call.</p>
    <h4>Includes</h4>
        <p>Include files for this application. Notice the Windows specific include files - these 
	  are not necessary for Linux only applications</p>
        =semlit,insert,includes=
    <h4>Windows Only</h4>
        <p>Windows applications must initialize the Winsock library to utilize sockets.</p>
        =semlit,insert,windows=
        <p>If this fails, the application should exit since sockets will not be operational.</p>
