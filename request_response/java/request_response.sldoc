    <h1>Request-Response Sample Application</h1>
    <p>Ultra Messaging offers a Request/Response messaging model. A regular UM source can use a dedicated API to send a request
	on its publishing topic. A receiver for that topic will receive the request similar to regular data messages, and can use
	a dedicated API to send a response back to the source.</p>
    <p>When a request message is sent, the message is published on the same transport that the source is configured to use. 
     	Response messages on the other hand are sent directly to the source from the receiver via Unicast Immediate Messaging (UIM),
	which is a direct TCP connection.</p>
    <p>An important aspect of UM's Request/Response model is that it allows the application to keep track of which request 
	corresponds to a given response. Due to the asynchronous nature of UM requests, any number of requests can be outstanding, 
	and as the responses come in, they can be matched to their corresponding requests.</p>
    <p>In this demonstration of Request/Response, the application create a single context, then a source and receier on topic
	"test.topic". Once the source and receiver are created, the source publishes a single request message, then the main 
	application thread wait until the receiver callback receives the request, and replies with a response. Once the source
	callback for the response message is executed, the application sets a flag for the main application thread to cleanly exit</p>
    <p>There is one program source file:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b><tt>=semlit,srcfile,request_response_java.slsrc,request_response.java=</tt></b>
        - (right-click and save as "request_response.java") main program.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Program explanation: <tt>request_response.java</tt></h2>
    <h4>Create Context</h4>
	<p>The first phase of any UM program is initialization, where UM objects are created. The first object to be created is a UM 
	context object</p>
	=semlit,insert,context_create=
    <h4>Create Receiver and Message Callback Function</h4>
	<p>First, the application must register a LBMReceiverCallback object</p>
	=semlit,insert,init_cb=
	<p>The receiver callback class is defined as "ReceiverCallback" in this application, and looks like this:</p>
	=semlit,insert,rcv_cb=
	<p> This callback function will be executed when the receiver receives a message, including request messages. The receiver 
	message handler is executed for every single message delivered to the application from the UM library, and is where the 
	application typically processes the message data.
	<p>Next, the application initializes a receiver attribute object called rcv_attr, which is then used to create the topic. 
	Attribute objects are used to configure particular settings for a receiver rather than using the default values or from an inherited
	configuration file. An LBMTopic object is create next, and this is required for all receivers as it defines which context, the 
	name of the topic string the receiver will use, and the attribute object. Finally, the receiver object, LBMReceiver, is created using 
	a reference to the previously initialized ReceiverCallback object and LBMTopic object.</p>
	=semlit,insert,create_rcv=
    <h4>Create source, Send Request and Response Handler Callback</h4>
	<p>After creating the receiver, the application then initializes the source topic and creates the source which will be used to 
	send the request:</p>
	=semlit,insert,create_src=
	</p>Once the source is successfully created, the request object needs to be initialized. The request object is responsible for 
	sending the request and is also responsible for receiving responses. It is important to track the request within the application,
	and close it when all responses have been received. Once the request object is initialized with the payload for the request, a 
	response handler must be added as a means of processing response messages back from the receiver(s). The response callback is similar
	to the receiver message callback.</p>
	=semlit,insert,create_req=
	<p>And the response handler class and function:</p>
	=semlit,insert,resp_cb=
	<p>Now the application is ready to send the request:</p>
	=semlit,insert,send_req=
	<p>The main application thread will now wait for the response to be received before continuing. Once this sample application gets a 
	response, it sets the "run" variable to 0 to instruct the main application thread to exit.</p> 
    <h4>Send Response</h4>
	<p>Inside the Message Callback function, which is where the receiver processes the request message that was
	just sent, the sample application sends the response using the msg.respond() API. Note the LBM.SRC_NONBLOCK flag as the last paramter 
	- this is absolutely crucial since the application is attempting to send the message from within the receiver message callback, which 
	executes on the UM context thread. Using a non-blocking send of any kind within a context thread callback is required calling a blocking call
	on the context thread can result in application deadlock.</p>
	=semlit,insert,send_response=
    <h4>Main Loop</h4>
	<p>Once the receiver and source are created, and the request message is sent, there is nothing else for the main application thread 
	to do but wait for the response to be received. Once the response is received within the ResponseCallback function, the run variable
	will be set to 0 and the loop will break</p>
	=semlit,insert,loop=
    <h4>Cleanup</h4>
	<p>As previously stated, it is important to cleanup the request object. For applications that send thousands of requests, or more, 
	the memory utilization for the uncleaned request objects will become apparent, and can even lead to longer latencies for request/response
	when not properly cleaned.</p>
	<p>Once the request is deleted, the source, receiver and context can be deleted</p>
	=semlit,insert,clean=
