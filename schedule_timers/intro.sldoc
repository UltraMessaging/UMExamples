    <h1>Scheduling UM Timers</h1>
    <p>Ultra Messaging has a feature where developers can schedule timer function callbacks via the API, where
       the desired function is executed in a desired number of milliseconds from when it was scheduled. The
       callback itself must be created by the developer, and it is executed by the UM context thread or via
       a UM Event Queue, if an Event Queue is passed in via the API.</p>
    <p>In this example, the application will schedule a timer callback to execute in 1 second. The main thread
       that scheduled the timer will wait for the timer to execute, then clean up the application and exit</p>
