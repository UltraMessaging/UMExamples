    <h1>Scheduling UM Timers</h1>
    <p>Ultra Messaging has a feature where developers can schedule timer function callbacks via the API, where
       the desired function is executed in a desired number of milliseconds from when it was scheduled. The 
       callback itself must be created by the developer, and it is executed by the UM context thread or via
       a UM Event Queue, if an Event Queue is passed in via the API.</p>
    <p>In this example, the application will schedule a timer callback to execute in 1 second. The main thread
       that scheduled the timer will wait for the timer to execute, then clean up the application and exit</p>
    <p>There is one program source file:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b><tt>=semlit,srcfile,schedule_timers_dotnet.slsrc,ScheduleTimers.cs=</tt></b>
        - (right-click and save as "ScheduleTimers.cs") main program.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Program explanation: <tt>ScheduleTimers.java</tt></h2>
    <h4>Initializing the Context</h4>
        <p>Standard context creation code. Creating and scheduling timers only required an LBM context, no sources or receivers are needed.</p>
        =semlit,insert,ctx_create=
    <h4>Creating a Callback</h4>
	<p>The callback class defined below is the application callback that will be invoked when the scheduled timer expires. This callback will
	be executed on the UM context thread (at least for the purpose of this example it will be executed on the context thread.</p>
	=semlit,insert,timer_cb=
	<p>Note that inside the callback, the global "wait" variable is set to 0, this allows the main thread to stop tight-looping and exit.</p>
    <h4>Scheduling the Timer Callback</h4>
	<p>Here the application is actually initializing and scheduling the callback timer, set to be executed in 1000 milliseconds. The return value should be saved
	by the application in the event that the application wishes to cancel the timer before it executes. Special care must be taken when cancelling
	timer callbacks, for more information please see <a href="cancelling_timers/java/index.html>cancelling_timers</a>.</p>
	=semlit,insert,schedule_timer=
    <h4>Wait for Timer</h4>
	<p>For the purpose of this example application, it is using the global variable "wait" as a semaphore essentially. Once the timer executes, wait
	will be set to 0 and the application can cleanly exit by deleting the context.</p>
	=semlit,insert,wait=
