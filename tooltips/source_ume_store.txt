Add a store specification to the list of stores specified for the source. Unlike most other UMP settings, every
time this setting is called, it adds another store specification to the list and does NOT overwrite previous
specifications.
Each entry contains the IP address, TCP port, registration ID, and group index for the store. For the
configuration file as well as string versions of this option, format the string value as
DomainID:IP:port:RegID:GroupIDX where DomainID is the store's UM domain ID, IP is the stores IP
address, port is the TCP port for the store, RegID is the registration ID that the source desires to use, and
GroupIDX is the group index that the store belongs to. The DomainID, RegID and GroupIDX pieces may be
left off the string if desired. If so, UMP assumes the value of 0 for them.
Because each entry adds a new store specification and does not overwrite previous values, an entry or string
with the IP address of 0.0.0.0 and TCP port of 0 causes the removal of all previous store specifications. A
single store specification means the source uses persistence. If no stores are specified, then persistence will
not be provided for the source.
