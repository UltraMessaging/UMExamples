Specifies the minimum size of the retained message buffer before UM can delete messages. The buffer must reach this size before UM can delete any messages older than retransmit_retention_age_threshold. For UMP, these options combined with retransmit_retention_size_limit affect the retention buffer size. A value of 0 sets the size threshold to be always triggered, in which case deletion is determined by other threshold criteria.

Scope:	source
Type:	size_t
