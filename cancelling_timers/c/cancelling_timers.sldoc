    <h1>Cancelling UM Timer Callbacks</h1>
    <p>Ultra Messaging has a feature where developers can schedule timer function callbacks via the API, where
       the desired function is executed in a desired number of milliseconds from when it was scheduled. Applications also have
       the ability to cancel scheduled timers that have not yet executed, however special care must be taken when cancelling timer
       callbacks.</p>
    <p>In this example, the application will schedule a timer callback to execute in 1 second. The main thread
       that scheduled the timer will wait for the timer to execute, then clean up the application and exit</p>
    <p>There is one program source file:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b><tt>=semlit,srcfile,schedule_timers_c.slsrc,schedule_timers.c=</tt></b>
        - (right-click and save as "schedule_timers.c") main program.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Program explanation: <tt>schedule_timers.c</tt></h2>
    <h4>Initializing the Context</h4>
        <p>Standard context attribute initializtion and context creation code. For more information on creating a context, please see the example
          <a href="../context-create">Creating a Context</a></p>
        =semlit,insert,ctx_create=
    <h4>Creating a Callback</h4>
	<p>The callback function defined below is the application callback that will be invoked when the scheduled timer expires. This callback will
	be executed on the UM context thread (at least for the purpose of this example it will be executed on the context thread.</p>
	=semlit,insert,timer_cb=
	<p>Note that inside the callback, the global "wait" variable is set to 0, this allows the main thread to stop tight-looping and exit.</p>
    <h4>Scheduling the Timer Callback</h4>
	<p>Here the application is actually scheduling the callback timer, set to be executed in 1000 milliseconds. The return value should be saved
	by the application in the event that the application wishes to cancel the timer before it executes. Special care must be taken when cancelling
	timer callback, for more information please see <a href="cancelling_timers/c/index.html>cancelling_timers</a>.</p>
	=semlit,insert,schedule=
    <h4>Wait for Timer</h4>
	<p>For the purpose of this example application, it is using the global variable "wait" as a semaphore essentially. Once the timer executes, wait
	will be set to 0 and the application can cleanly exit by deleting the context.</p>
	=semlit,insert,wait=
    <h4>Error Checking</h4>
        <p>Error handling can be one of the most complicated issues facing a programmer. Each application may have its own unique error
        handling conventions. For these example programs, a very simplistic error handling approach is taken: if anything unexpected happens,
        print a message and exit the program:</p>
        =semlit,insert,error_check=
        <p>The EX_LBM_CHK() macro checks a UM API return value. If negative, it assumes an error. One reason for making this a macro is so
        that the __FILE__ and __LINE__ compiler built-ins reference the file and line of the usages of the macro, not the file and line of
        the macro defintion itself.</p>
        </p>Most UM functions are designed to return one of only two integer values: 0 for success and -1 for failure. The lbm.h header file
        defines the symbols LBM_OK and LBM_FAILURE respectively for these. However, there are a few functions which can return a value of 0 or
        greater in the event of success (for example: lbm_event_dispatch() and lbm_send_response() to name two). So the example EX_LBM_CHK()
        macro was written to be somewhat more general. However, be aware that there are a few other functions which do not return an integer
        status at all (for exmaple: lbm_serialize_response() to name one). Please refer to the API documentation for each UM function you call.</p>
    <h4>Includes</h4>
        <p>Include files for this application. Notice the Windows specific include files - these are not necessary for Linux only applications</p>
