    <h1>Handling and Logging UMP Receiver Callbacks</h1>
	<p>Most applications that use Ultra Messaging (UM) are already logging a lot of application specific data. Sometimes, these logs 
	can be as large as multiple gigabytes, per day! So it is understandable that users will want to keep their UM specific items to a 
	minimum and focus on the application logging. That being said, there is some crucial data that should be logged pertaining to the 
	Ultra Messaging Persistence (UMP) framework as, without this data, debugging problems related to messaging can be near impossible. 
	This sample offers you the data that is most important to log, and the reason why this data is so important to track.</p>
