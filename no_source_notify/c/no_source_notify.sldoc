    =semlit,include,../intro.sldoc=
    <p>There is one program source file:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b><tt>=semlit,srcfile,no_source_notify_c.slsrc,no_source_notify.c=</tt></b>
        - (right-click and save as "no_source_notify.c") main program.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Program explanation: <tt>no_source_notify.c</tt></h2>
    <h4>Variables</h4>
	<p>First there is a macro to define the number of queries threshold before the notification is executed</p>
	=semlit,insert,num_queries=
	<p>Next there is the global flag variable which the main application thread will wait on.</p>
	=semlit,insert,no_source_var=
    <h4>Configure the Threshold Attribute</h4>
	<p>The receiver option 
	=semlit,tooltip,../../tooltips/receiver_resolution_no_source_notification_threshold.txt,resolution_no_source_notification_threshold=
	configures the notification to execute after the specified value for queries are published without an advertisement response. 
	The attribute can be configured programatically like so:</p>
	=semlit,insert,set_attr=
	<p>This sample configures the query threshold to 25, which with the default topic resolution settings AND no active source for topic
	"test.topic", the notification callback should execute within a couple seconds of the receiver being created</p>
    <h4>Handle the Notification Callback</h4>
	<p>Finally, the application should handle the notification callback inside the receivers message handler. For the purpose of this sample,
	we will simply print a message to stdout.</p>
	=semlit,insert,no_source_cb=
    <h4>Includes</h4>
        <p>Include files for this application. Notice the Windows specific include files - these
          are not necessary for Linux only applications</p>
        =semlit,insert,includes=
    <h4>Windows Only</h4>
        <p>Windows applications must initialize the Winsock library to utilize sockets.</p>
        =semlit,insert,windows=
        <p>If this fails, the application should exit since sockets will not be operational.</p>
