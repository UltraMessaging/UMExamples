<p>There is one program source file:</p>
<ul>
<li><b><tt>=semlit,srcfile,dump_attributes_java.slsrc,dump_attributes.java=</tt></b>
- (right-click and save as "dump_attributes.java") Example code.</li>
</ul>

<h2><tt>dump_attributes.java</tt></h2>

<p>The example source code is organized as a Java class.</p>

<h3>Initialization</h3>

<p>The first phase of any UM program is initialization, where UM objects are
created. The first object to be created is a UM context object:</p>
=semlit,insert,ctx_create=

<p>A context can be thought of as an "instance" of UM. It contains a worker
thread which maintains internal state and reacts to socket events. Most UM
applications create a single context instance which manages the publishing
and receiving of messages over many topics, although there are less-common
use cases which call for multiple context instances within a single process
(see TODO).</p>


<p>The next object that needs to be created is a "source" object. Creation
of a source object is a two-step procedure: first create a "topic" object,
specifying the topic name, and then create the "source" object, which is
the object used subsequently to send messages.</p>
=semlit,insert,src_create=

<p>In this example, a second source is created.  The only difference between
between the 2 sources created in this example is that they are configured to 
use different destination ports.  This will enable the user to view differences
in the attributes that will be dumped later. </p>
=semlit,insert,src_create2=

<h3>Dump Attributes</h3>

<p>In this block, we will dump every attribute that the context object is 
configured to use.  Many of these values are expected to be default.  This
is because only the <tt>resolver_multicast_address</tt> was set to a non-default value
in the beginning of this example program.  In a non-trivial application, it is 
common for many of the default attributes to be overridden by a configuration 
file, xml file, or programatically.</p>
=semlit,insert,dump_ctx_attr=

<p>In this block, we will dump every attribute that the first source object is 
configured to use.  Many of these values are expected to be default.  This source
is configured to use a non-default <tt>transport</tt> and <tt>transport_lbtrm_destination_port</tt>.
These values can be seen the console output of this applciation.</p>
=semlit,insert,dump_src_attr=

<p>Here, the second source's attributes will be dumped.  The only difference
between the two sources in this example is the <tt>transport_lbtrm_destination_port</tt>.  
This can be viewed in the console output of the example application.</p>
=semlit,insert,dump_src_attr=


<h3>Cleanup</h3>

<p>This block contains the code necessary to clean up the remaining lbm objects.
Unlike most common practices in Java, most UM objects should be explicitly
closed when they are no longer needed. Since most UM objects contain an active
component, just letting them go out of scope to be garbage collected is not an
appropriate way to dispose of them. Note that the srcAttr oject does not have 
a close method.  In order to close this object, it can be tied to an "object 
recycler, as was done on srcAttr's constructor.  This will allow the recycler 
clean up the ojbect when the recyclers .close method is called. <p>

<p>When deleting UM objects, order of deletion is important:</p>
=semlit,insert,delobj=

<p>In general, timers should be cancelled first. Then source and receiver
objects should be deleted, then context objects, and lastly event queues.
These object deletions can become somewhat complex if event queues are
used; see TODO for more explanation.</p>
