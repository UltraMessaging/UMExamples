    <h1>How to use an Event Queue with a receiver</h1>
    <p>An event queue is an object in the UM library that allows a receiver to process events on an application thread. By default all events
	are processed on the context thread.  This context thread is created automatically when the context object is instantiated.  This thread is a 
	shared resource between all sources, receivers and timers, both internally in the UM library and externally in the application.  This can quickly 
	become a bottleneck if an application is doing lots of things, like receiving messages, tracking timers related to UMP, or event getting lots of 
	other events related to the UM library.  Therefore, at a slight cost to performance (1 thread switch), an application can use its own thread, or 
	as many as it likes.  One way to do this is to use the event queue.</p>
    <p>There is one program source file:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b><tt>=semlit,srcfile,event_q_rcv_c.slsrc,event_q_rcv.c=</tt></b>
        - (right-click and save as "event_q_rcv.c") main program.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Program explanation: <tt>event_q_rcv.c</tt></h2>
    <h4>Creating the Event Queue</h4>
        <p>The eventQ is initialized by calling lbm_event_queue_create with no other arguments: </p>
        =semlit,insert,evq_create=
    <h4>Create a receiver with an event queue.</h4>
	<p>To "hook up" a receiver to an event queue, simply pass it into the receive create function.  Note that all further
		events will be delivered to the event queue.  They will not be processed until lbm_event_dispatch is called with the event queue.</p>
	=semlit,insert,rcv_create=
    <h4>Processing Events on the Event Queue</h4>
	<p>To run an event queue on a specific thread, simply call lbm_event_dispatch() with an argument (time in milliseconds).  This
	will execute events on the event queue on the thread that called lbm_event_dispatch for the specified amount of time. In this case
	the main() thread will execute events for 10 seconds.</p>
	=semlit,insert,evq_run=
    <h4>Cleanup</h4>
	<p>When using an event queue, care must be taken in order to cleanly shut down.  Issues can potentially occur
	if a context tries to deliver events to the queue after it has already been _delete()'ed.  Therefore, the application 
	should delete all receivers, then the context itself.  This will prevent any new events from being generated.  Once the
	queue is empty and no new events are being generated, the event queue can safely be delete()'ed.</p>
