<title>check_flight_size_ewouldblock.cs: Checking Flight Size in C#/.NET</title>

<p>There is one program source file:</p>
<ul>
<li><b><tt>=semlit,srcfile,check_flight_size_ewouldblock_cs.slsrc,check_flight_size_ewouldblock.cs=</tt></b>
- (right-click and save as "check_flight_size_ewouldblock.cs") Example code.</li>
</ul>

<h2><tt>check_flight_size_ewouldblock.cs</tt></h2>

<p>The example source code is organized as a .NET class.</p>

<h3>Store Setup</h3>

<p>This example will check flight size.  Flight size is a UMP (UME) feature
that is only applicable when stores are used.  In this example, we have provided
one store XML, and are configuring the application to use one store:</p>

=semlit,insert,store_cfg=

<p>Note that while only 1 store is required for testing purposes, all production
deployments should use a minimum of three stores. Failure to do so may result in
blocking in the event of failure.  In this example, we will assume no failures, 
so one store is enough for demonstration purposes. </p>


<h3>Checking Flight Size</h3>

<p>When sending messages: </p>

=semlit,insert,src_send=

<p>There are two potential reasons that a store can block.  The first reason
is that the lbtrm rate limit was exceeded.  The second reason is that the 
application exceeded it's <tt>ume_flight_size</tt> limit. The exceptions thrown
by the UM library do not distinguish between the two, therefore it is necessary
to check flight size via the API to resolve the type of exception. The following
block of code demonstrates how to handle an exception and check for flight size:</p>

=semlit,insert,flight_size_check=

<p>Exceeding flight size may mean there is a problem receiving ACKs from a store.
This could mean a number of things. The stores could be slow and or busy, which 
is indicative of a potential capacity problem. There could be a communication/network
issue preventing timely ACKs.  It could also be that message volumes were higher 
than was tested and or anticipated. Whatever, the issue, it is often important to log
and or otherwise raise the issue.  A source which is blocked due to exceeding the 
configured flight size can no longer publish.<p>
