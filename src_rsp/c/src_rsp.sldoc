	<h1>How to use sources to send requests and responses.</h1>

	<p>There are two source files associated with this example:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b><tt>=semlit,srcfile,client_c.slsrc,client.c=</tt></b>
		- (right-click and save as "client.c").</li>
		<li><b><tt>=semlit,srcfile,server_c.slsrc,server.c=</tt></b>
		- (right-click and save as "server.c").</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The UM "request/response" feature provides a convenient, easy-to-code
	method for a classic server program to respond to a request sent by a client.
	The feature takes care of routing the server's response message back to
	the client that sent the request.
	It also associates response messages with the corresponding request
	messages, even if multiple messages are outstanding.
	See <a href="../../request_response/c/">Request-Response Sample</a>.</p>

	<p>However, there are advantages for the server to use a normal UM
	source to send response messages:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Choice of transport types.
		UM responses are always sent with TCP.

		<li>Reliability settings for non-TCP transports are under user control.
		Can be configured to recover messages after long network outages.

		<li>Extra layer of reliability.
		The "OTR" feature can recover messages unrecoverably lost by the transport.

		<li>Better application visibility.
		Unicast transport types give connect and disconnect events for the
		source, and receivers get BOS and EOS events.

		<li>UDP-based transport types can give lower latency.
	</ul>

	<p>This sample program uses an LBT-RU source to return response messages
	to the requesting client program.</p>

    <h2>Overall Approach</h2>

	<p>Clients use a UM source to send a request to a server, and the server
	uses a UM receiver to receive it.
	The server then uses a UM source to send a response back to only the
	client that sent the request, and that client uses a UM receiver to
	receive it.
	This sample allows and arbitrary number of client programs to come and
	go, without the server being pre-configured to know about them.</p>

	<p>When a client program initializes, it creates a source to send
	requests and a receiver to receive responses.
	The client then exchanges one or more handshakes to register with the
	server, and to verify round-trip connectivity.
	This avoids initial message loss due to topic resolution.</p>

    <h2>Registration</h2>

	<p>The client uses the server's well-known request topic to create
	the source.</p>

	=semlit,insert,server_name=
	<p><tt>. . .</tt></p>
	=semlit,insert,req_src_create=

	<p>The client needs a unique topic to receive is responses.
	Using the process PID is an easy, but not robust method..</p>

	=semlit,insert,client_name=
	<p><tt>. . .</tt></p>
	=semlit,insert,rsp_rcv_create=

	<h4>Registration; Client Side</h4>

	<p>The registration message that the client sends to the server is
	all-ascii, consisting of lower-case 'r' followed by a null-terminated 
	topic name on which the client receives responses.</p>

	=semlit,insert,register_msg=

	<p>The client sends registration messages repeatedly in a loop, with
	exponential backoff delays.
	For example, if the server is not running, the client sends registration
	attempts at 1, 2, 4, 8, ... milliseconds, to a maximum of 1 second.</p>

	=semlit,insert,register_loop=

	<p>The loop exits when the client receives a registration response.</p>

	=semlit,insert,register_done=

	<h4>Registration; Server Side</h4>

	<p>The server makes use of source notification create/delete callbacks
	to manage client state.
	The callbacks are configured as part of creation of the server's
	main receiver.</p>

	=semlit,insert,src_notif_setopt=

	<p>Then, when the receiver discovers a new client's source,
	start_client_source() is called.
	That function only creates the state structure associated with the
	new client.</p>

	=semlit,insert,start_client=

	<p>When the client sends its registration message, it is received by
	the server, which uses it to create the source used for sending
	responses.
	The state structure created above is passed to the receiver
	callback in <tt>msg->source_clientd</tt>.</p>

	=semlit,insert,do_reg0=

	<p>Registration requests start with the character 'r'.</p>

	=semlit,insert,do_reg1=
	<p><tt>. . .</tt></p>
	=semlit,insert,do_reg2=

	<p>The response source is created in a special way.
	It is an LBT-RU transport type, with a fixed port number (the choice
	of 12070 was arbitrary).
	This means that all clients' sources are mapped to the same LBT-RU
	transport session.</p>

	=semlit,insert,rsp_src_config=

	<p>To prevent each client's responses from being sent to all clients,
	source-side filtering is enabled.</p>

	=semlit,insert,rsp_src_config2=

	<p>On successful source creation, the client state is filled in.
	But no reply is sent to the client.
	This is because the client has not yet had a chance to discover and
	join the new source, so any message sent at this point would not
	be delivered.</p>

	=semlit,insert,rsp_src_created=

	<p>The server could set some kind of timer to send its reply, but
	to simplify this code, we just wait for the client to retry.
	When the next registration request comes in, we send the OK
	message.
	Thus, it will always take at least 2 tries to register.</p>

	=semlit,insert,rsp_src_ok=

    <h2>Request/Response</h2>

	<p>This example does not contain the code necessary to associate responses
	with their requests.
	However, the simple protocol was designed to allow this to be added.
	A request message consists of an 8-ascii-byte header followed by the
	application message content.
./run.sh client
	The first byte of the header is the character 'R' to indicate a request
	message.
	The other 7 bytes are currently just set to ascii '0' characters, but
	could be used as a request ID.
	When the server responds to requests, it uses the same header it
	received, so the client can maintain a table of outstanding requests.
	This logic is not included in this example.</p>

	<h4>Request; Client Side</h4>

	<p>In this example, the send buffer for requests is declared as an
	arbitrary large buffer.
	The header is initialized once.</p>

	=semlit,insert,req_buf=

	<p>For this simple example, 5 requests are sent.</p>

	=semlit,insert,req_sends=

	<h4>Response; Server Side</h4>

	<p>When the server receives the request, it sends a response.<p>

	=semlit,insert,do_req1=
	<p><tt>. . .</tt></p>
	=semlit,insert,do_req2=
