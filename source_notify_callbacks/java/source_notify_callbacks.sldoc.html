    <h1>Receiver Source Notification Callbacks (Create and Delete)</h1>
    <p>This example demonstrates how to configure and code the callbacks for when a receiver creates and deletes a 
       delivery controller for a specific source. This is typically done in support of maintaining per-source
       state information.</p>
    <p>Like many other callback function in UM, the source notification is configured via a receiver attribute, 
       <a href="#" title="Callback functions (and associated client data pointer) that are called when a receiver creates or deletes a delivery controller associated with a source. For the creation function, the application has the ability to set the source client data pointer to be used in each message received from the source. This callback is called directly in line and does not use the event queue. Therefore the callback function used should not block or it will block the context thread processing. A value of NULL for the callback turns off the callback being called.

Scope:	receiver
Type:	lbm_rcv_src_notification_func_t
Default value:	NULL
When to Set:	Can only be set during object initialization.
Config File:	Cannot be set from an UM configuration file.

which
       must be set programatically so that the appropriate function pointers can be provided.</p>
    <p>Inside the UM library, there is a concept of a <b>transport</b> and a <b>delivery controller</b>. It is important
       to understand the difference and characteristics of each and how it related to your application. A <b>transport</b>
       is the network connection that is used as the medium for publishing/subscribing to messages. For example, LBTRM
       (reliable multicast) is a transport which publishes on a specific multicast group and port. A transport may contain
       a single UM topic, or it could contain many UM topics; it depends on how a publishing application configures itself
       and its sources.</p>
    <p>A <b>delivery controller</b> is the internal mechanism that takes messages from a transport for a specific topic
       and then delivers those messages to the receiver application, given that the application has a receiver that is
       interested in that topic.</p>
    <p>When a new transport is detected by a UM receiver application, you may notice that the receiver application executes
       the Beginning of Session (BOS) callback. This is great information for the application to log because it can be used
       to help debug networking issues. However, this callback is not great at telling the application that a specific topic 
       ready to start receiving messages. Instead, the application can use the source_notification_callback which is
       demonstrated in this sample application. The source_notification_callback can enable a user callback to be executed
       when delivery controller is created for a topic and a separate callback for when a delivery controller is deleted.</p>

    <h4>Delivery Controller Create Callback</h4>
	<p>Here the user callback for the delivery controller being created is defined. This function will execute every 
	time a source is detected (when a source's topic advertisement is received by the receiver's context) that the 
	receiver is interested in. This callback will execute before a BOS would because BOS required data on the transport
	to be received, unlike this function which just requires a TIR on an interested source.<p>

    <h4>Delivery Controller Delete Callback</h4>
	<p>This is the user callback for when the delivery controller is deleted. A delivery controller would be deleted
	if the topic hasn't received any data for the transport activity timeout. This is typically around the same time as 
	an EOS, though not guaranteed if the transport remains active even if the topic is just deleted. Therefore it is better
	to rely on this callback versus EOS, because this callback is guaranteed if no data has been received for the topic.</p>
