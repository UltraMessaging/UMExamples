    <p>There is one program source file:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b><tt>=semlit,srcfile,source_notify_callbacks_c.slsrc,source_notify_callbacks.c=</tt></b>
        - (right-click and save as "source_notify_callbacks.c") main program.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Program explanation: <tt>source_notify_callbacks.c</tt></h2>
    <h4></h4>
    <h4>Per-source State Information</h4>
	<p>As new sources are discovered for the receiver, the user wants to create and maintain some state information
        associated with that source. In this simple example, just keep a per-source count of messages received.</p>
	=semlit,insert,state=
    <h4>Delivery Controller Create Callback</h4>
	<p>Here the user callback for the delivery controller being created is defined. This function will execute every 
	time a source is detected (when a source's topic advertisement is received by the receiver's context) that the 
	receiver is interested in.
        UM expects the function to return a pointer to the state information, which
        will subsequently be passed to the receive callback as msg->source_clientd.
        This callback will execute before a BOS would because BOS required data on the transport
	to be received, unlike this function which just requires a TIR on an interested source.</p>
	=semlit,insert,create_cb=
    <h4>Delivery Controller Delete Callback</h4>
	<p>This is the user callback for when the delivery controller is deleted. A delivery controller would be deleted
	if the topic hasn't received any data for the transport activity timeout. This is typically around the same time as 
	an EOS, though not guaranteed if the transport remains active even if the topic is just deleted. Therefore it is better
	to rely on this callback versus EOS, because this callback is guaranteed if no data has been received for the topic.</p>
	=semlit,insert,delete_cb=
    <h4>Standard Receive Callback</h4>
	<p>This is the standard receiver callback where messages are processed, as well as events like BOS and EOS</p>
	=semlit,insert,receive_cb=
    <h4>Declare Notify Structure</h4>
	<p>To properly set the receiver attribute 
	=semlit,tooltip,../../tooltips/receiver_source_notification_function.txt,source_notification_function=this structure 
	must be used to set the user callbacks which have been defined above.</p>
	=semlit,insert,srccb_var=
    <h4>Set the Callbacks and Configure Parameter</h4>
	<p>Finally, set the creation and deletion callback appropriately to the previously defined UM object, and then use
	the API to configure the paramter:</p>
	=semlit,insert,set_cbs=
    <h4>Includes</h4>
        <p>Include files for this application. Notice the Windows specific include files - these
          are not necessary for Linux only applications</p>
        =semlit,insert,includes=
    <h4>Windows Only</h4>
        <p>Windows applications must initialize the Winsock library to utilize sockets.</p>
        =semlit,insert,windows=
        <p>If this fails, the application should exit since sockets will not be operational.</p>
