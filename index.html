<h2>Welcome to UMExamples</h2>
<p>Ultra Messaging Examples (UMExamples) is a documentation suite aimed at providing high quality educational samples
for the Informatica Ultra Messaging (UM) product line. Every sample in the suite is coded ready to compile, though
may not act as a great application as is. These examples are provided to instruct users of the UM API on how to use
the API and best practices with regard to UM functionality. Along with each sample application is detailed documentation
describing the purpose of the example, and walks through the sample code to provide clear instruction on how to best use
Ultra Messaging.

<p>UMExamples is created with SEMLIT, an open source documentation tool available here <a href="https://github.com/fordsfords/semlit">SEMLIT</a></p>
