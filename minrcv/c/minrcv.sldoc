<p>There is one program source file:</p>
<ul>
<li><b><tt>=semlit,srcfile,minsrc_c.slsrc,minsrc.c=</tt></b>
- (right-click and save as "minsrc.c") Example code.</li>
</ul>

<h2><tt>minsrc.c</tt></h2>

<h3>Initialization</h3>

<p>The first phase of any UM program is initialization, where UM objects are
created. The first object to be created is a UM context object:</p>
=semlit,insert,ctx_create=

<p>A context can be thought of as an "instance" of UM. It contains a worker
thread which maintains internal state and reacts to socket events. Most UM
applications create a single context instance which manages the publishing
and receiving of messages over many topics, although there are less-common
use cases which call for multiple context instances within a single process
(see TODO).</p>

<p>Also note the use of <tt>EX_LBM_CHK(err)</tt>. This is a simple error
handling macro, described more-fully later on.</p>

<p>The next object that needs to be created is a "source" object. Creation
of a source object is a two-step procedure: first create a "topic" object,
specifying the topic name, and then create the "source" object, which is
the object used subsequently to send messages.</p>
=semlit,insert,src_create=

<p>The first thing to note is the use curly braces to create a block. This
is not necessary, but is done in this example to emphasize that the
<tt>topic</tt> variable is only used as a bridge between the following
two function calls. The <tt>lbm_src_topic_alloc()</tt> function allocates
a topic object internally inside the context and returns a handle to that
object. However, there is only one thing that can be done with a topic
object: use it to create a source object. Once that source object is created,
the application no longer needs to retain the topic object. It is unique among
UM objects in that the application does not need to manage or clean up topic
objects explicitly -- e.g. there is no <tt>lbm_src_topic_dealloc()</tt> function.</p>

<p>Note that it would be unusual for a real application to create a single
topic for all its communication needs. Most real-world applications would
create several sources, all within the same context. Just be aware that each
one requires the same topic_alloc/src_create pairing.<p>

<p>The final step during initialization is to wait for any subscribing
applications to discover this new source:</p>
=semlit,insert,tr_sleep=

<p>Note the use of <tt>SLEEP(1)</tt>.  This is a simple macro which puts
the caller to sleep for the specified number of seconds, and is described
more-fully later on.</p>

<p>This process is called "topic resolution", and takes a non-zero amount of time.
If the publisher sends a message before the discovery process completes, some
subscribers will not receive the message. This example takes the very simple
approach waiting for a full second before sending its first (and only) message,
but while this is usually more than enough time, there are scenarios where more
time is needed (e.g. if large numbers of source objects are created all at once).
Many users want a simple, fool-proof method for knowing when it is "safe" to send
(i.e. when all pre-existing receivers will successfully receive the message);
unfortunately, no such one-size-fits-all approach exists. The subject is
addressed in more depth in TODO.</p>

<h3>Publishing</h3>

<p>Now that initialization is complete, it is time to send a message:</p>
=semlit,insert,sending=

<p>Note that the string "Hello!" only has 6 characters, but a 7 is passed as the
number of bytes. This is to ensure that the null string character is included in
the message. Also note the inclusion of the FLUSH and SRC_BLOCK flags.</p>

<p>The SRC_BLOCK flag technically does not need to be supplied since the default
behavior is blocking, but this example supplies it anyway just to emphasize the fact
that the application expects the send to block (go to sleep) if a blocking condition
is encountered. For an example of non-blocking sends, see TODO.<p>

<p>The FLUSH flag is used to override the default UM behavior of using implicit
batching. Batching is the process of combining multiple outgoing messages into a
single network packet. This is done for efficiency so that high message rates can
be achieved. However, using implicit batching can introduce message latencies of
many milliseconds, so it is not unusual for UM applications to send with the
FLUSH flag to push the message onto the network immediately. The tradeoff with
this simplistic approach is that at high message rates, a significant load is imposed
on both the sender and the receiver. For a somewhat more complex "intelligent
batching" example, see TODO.</p>

<p>The UM API is thread-safe, meaning that the application might have multiple
threads concurrently calling <tt>lbm_src_send()</tt>. However, be aware that
there are situations where those threads will contend for internal locks
(mutexes), leading to decreased parallelism and throughput. Source threading
issues are explored in TODO.<p>

<h3>Cleanup</h3>

<p>When its time to delete UM objects, certain guideliens should be followed.
There are several possible asynchronous operations which might not yet have
completed since the last send, so a short sleep is included:</p>
=semlit,insert,linger=

<p>For example, if the FLUSH flag is not supplied with the send function, the
implicit batcher might be holding on to one or more messages, and must be
allowed to time out. Or a UDP protocol might be used and a subscriber might
have experienced "tail loss", requiring a timeout/retransmission sequence
to take place. As with source creation, many users want to know how long to
wait before deleting objects, and as before there is no perfect answer.
For example, the default NAK generation interval is 10 seconds, suggesting
that the linger should be at least that long. But a 10-second wait before
allowing a program to exit may not be acceptable, and is rarely needed.
Many users take the attitude that if a subscriber is still trying to recover
loss packets after 2 or 3 seconds, then it is better to just let that
subscriber experience unrecoverable loss.<p>

<p>When deleting UM objects, order of deletion is important:</p>
=semlit,insert,delobj=

<p>In general, timers should be cancelled first. Then source and receiver
objects should be deleted, then context objects, and lastly event queues.
These object deletions can become somewhat complex if event queues are
used; see TODO for more explanation.</p>
