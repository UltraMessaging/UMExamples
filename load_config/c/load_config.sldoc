    <h1>Loading Configuration Files</h1>
    <p>Ultra Messaging is highly dependent on the configuration attributes applied to each of the components in the library to
       meet the requirements for an application. As described in the
       <a href="http://ultramessaging.github.io/UMExamples/setting_attributes/c/index.html" target="_top">Setting Attributes</a>
       sample application, attributes can be set programatically using the UM API. However, this can be tedious and even problematic
       as it is not easy to maintain across a network of hundreds or even thousands of UM applications. Therefore, it makes more sense
       to centralize a UM application configuration, and using UM configuration files was designed just for this purpose.</p>
    <p>Ultra Messaging configuration files can be flat files, where each attribute is defined by its scope, the name of the attirbute, 
       and the desired value for said attribute. Each entry is formatted like so:</p>
    <p style="text-indent:10"><b>scope attribute_name desired_value</b><p>
    <p>For example, if the application wanted to set a source to use Ultra Messaging's reliable multicast 
       =semlit,tooltip,../../tooltips/source_transport.txt,transport=it would look like this:</p>
    <p style="text-indent:10"><b>source transport lbtrm</b></p>
    <p>Multiple flat files can be loaded via the API in a single application. For an attribute that is configured more than once when using
       multiple configuration files, the application will accept the value of the last file in which it is loaded as the default value. Using
       the API after loading a configuration file will also overwrite the value of a given attribute if configuring the same attributes.</p>
    <p>As of UM 5.0, applications have the ability to load XML formatted files, which provide significanly more flexibility with regard to using
       a single configuration file for multiple applications. XML files are far more flexible because applications can use pre-defined templates,
       and applications can use a very specific subset of defined values inside the configuration file by defining an Application Name.</p>
    <p>XML files differ slightly from flat files in that multiple XML files cannot be loaded within a single process; any attempt after the initial
       load will result in an error. XML files and flat files can be loaded within the same application however.</p>
    <p>There is one program source file and two configuration files:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b><tt>=semlit,srcfile,load_config_c.slsrc,load_config.c=</tt></b>
        - (right-click and save as "load_config.c") main program.</li>
      <li><b><tt>=semlit,srcfile,../flat_config.cfg,flat_config.cfg=</tt></b></li>
      <li><b><tt>=semlit,srcfile,../xml_config.xml,xml_config.xml=</tt></b></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Program explanation: <tt>load_config.c</tt></h2>
    <h4>Define Configuration File Names</h4>
	<p>There are certainly a lot of different methods for getting the path and name for a configuration file, however for the purposes
  	of this sample application, they are simply defined as macros</p>
	=semlit,insert,define_configs=
	<p>Also note the LBM_APPLICATION_NAME. This is needed for loading the XML configuration file</p>
    <h4>Load Flat File</h4>
	<p>Here the application is using lbm_config() to load the flat file "flat_config.cfg":</p>
	=semlit,insert,flat_file=
	<p>It is important to check for errors when loading configuration files as an error will be returned when using a malformed configuration
	file. Checking the LBM error message will elabortate on the malformed error specifically.</p>
        <p>It is worth noting here that this function call <b>can</b> be used to load XML files. However when using lbm_config() to load an XML
	file, it cannot assign an application name as opposed to using the lbm_config_xml_file() as shown below. Therefore it is highly recommended
	to use the lbm_config_xml_file() when loading XML configuration files</p>
    <h4>Load XML File</h4>
	<p>Very similar to loading a flat file, with the exception of the added parameter which indicates the name of the application, which points
	to specific attributes this application should be setting:</p>
	=semlit,insert,xml_file=
    <h4>Error Checking</h4>
        <p>Error handling can be one of the most complicated issues facing a programmer. Each application may have its own unique error
        handling conventions. For these example programs, a very simplistic error handling approach is taken: if anything unexpected happens,
        print a message and exit the program:</p>
        =semlit,insert,error_check=
        <p>The EX_LBM_CHK() macro checks a UM API return value. If negative, it assumes an error. One reason for making this a macro is so
        that the __FILE__ and __LINE__ compiler built-ins reference the file and line of the usages of the macro, not the file and line of
        the macro defintion itself.</p>
        </p>Most UM functions are designed to return one of only two integer values: 0 for success and -1 for failure. The lbm.h header file
        defines the symbols LBM_OK and LBM_FAILURE respectively for these. However, there are a few functions which can return a value of 0 or
        greater in the event of success (for example: lbm_event_dispatch() and lbm_send_response() to name two). So the example EX_LBM_CHK()
        macro was written to be somewhat more general. However, be aware that there are a few other functions which do not return an integer
        status at all (for exmaple: lbm_serialize_response() to name one). Please refer to the API documentation for each UM function you call.</p>
    <h4>Includes</h4>
        <p>A small effort was made to provide a some portability between Unix and Windows. For example:</p>
        =semlit,insert,includes=
	<p>Different sets of header files should be included for Unix v.s. Windows applications.</p>
